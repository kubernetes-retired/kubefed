# What is Kubebuilder

Kubebuilder is an SDK for rapidly building and publishing Kubernetes APIs in go.
It facilitates using canonical techniques used by core Kubernetes APIs as well as
techniques specific to extensions.

Similar to web development frameworks such as *Ruby on Rails* and *SpringBoot*,
Kubebuilder aims to simplify API development and to empower developers.

Included in Kubebuilder:

* Initializing new project library dependencies and structure.
* Bootstrapping API scaffolding code, tests, and documentation.
* High level abstractions wrapping client-go, apimachinery, and apiserver libraries.
* Building and publishing API container images and yaml config.
* Building and publish API reference documentation.
