# Kubernetes Federation v2

This repo contains an in-progress prototype of some of the
foundational aspects of V2 of Kubernetes Federation.  The prototype
builds on the sync controller (a.k.a. push reconciler) from
[Federation v1](https://github.com/kubernetes/federation/) to iterate
on the API concepts laid down in the [brainstorming
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/159cQGlfgXo6O4WxXyWzjZiPoIuiHVl933B43xhmqPEE/edit#)
and further refined in the [architecture
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ihWETo-zE8U_QNuzw5ECxOWX0Df_2BVfO3lC4OesKRQ/edit#).
Access to both documents is available to members of the
[kubernetes-sig-multicluster google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-multicluster).

# Concepts

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/concepts.png" width="711"></p>

Federation is configured with two types of information:

- **Type configuration** declares which API types federation should handle
- **Cluster configuration** declares which clusters federation should target

**Propagation** refers to the mechanism that distributes resources to federated
clusters.

Type configuration has three fundamental concepts:

- **Template types** define the representation of a resource common across clusters
- **Placement types** define which clusters the resource is intended to appear in
- **Override types** optionally define per-cluster field-level variation to apply to the template

These three abstractions provide a concise representation of a resource intended
to appear in multiple clusters. They encode the minimum information required for
**propagation** and are well-suited to serve as the glue between any given
propagation mechanism and higher-order behaviors like policy-based placement and
dynamic scheduling.

These fundamental concepts provide building blocks that can be used by
higher-level APIs:

- **Status** collects the status of resources distributed by federation across all federated clusters
- **Policy** determines which subset of clusters a resource is allowed to be distributed to
- **Scheduling** refers to a decision-making capability that can decide how 
  workloads should be spread across different clusters similar to how a human
  operator would
