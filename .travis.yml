# Note on configuration of quay account:
#
# The image push is done using a quay robot account configured in the
# kubernetes-multicluster org.
#
# There are two environment variables configured in travis that allow the travis
# build job to use this robot account:
#
# - QUAY_USERNAME
# - QUAY_PASSWORD
#
# These are statically configured in the travis settings and are set by travis
# in the build job's execution environment.
