# Kubernetes Cluster Federation

Kubernetes Cluster Federation is a Kubernetes Incubator project. It builds on the sync controller
(a.k.a. push reconciler) from [Federation v1](https://github.com/kubernetes/federation/)
to iterate on the API concepts laid down in the [brainstorming
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/159cQGlfgXo6O4WxXyWzjZiPoIuiHVl933B43xhmqPEE/edit#)
and further refined in the [architecture
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ihWETo-zE8U_QNuzw5ECxOWX0Df_2BVfO3lC4OesKRQ/edit#).
Access to both documents is available to members of the
[kubernetes-sig-multicluster google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-multicluster).

## For Helm v2

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.13+
- Helm 2.10+

### Configuring RBAC for Helm (Optional)

If your Kubernetes cluster has RBAC enabled, it will be necessary to
ensure that helm is deployed with a service account with the
permissions necessary to deploy KubeFed:

```bash
$ cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tiller
  namespace: kube-system
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tiller
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tiller
    namespace: kube-system
EOF

$ helm init --service-account tiller
```

### Installing the Chart

First, add the KubeFed chart repo to your local repository.
```bash
$ helm repo add kubefed-charts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/master/charts

$ helm repo list
NAME            URL
kubefed-charts   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/master/charts
```

With the repo added, available charts and versions can be viewed.
```bash
$ helm search kubefed
```

Install the chart and specify the version to install with the
`--version` argument. Replace `<x.x.x>` with your desired version.
```bash
$ helm install kubefed-charts/kubefed --name kubefed --version=<x.x.x> --namespace kube-federation-system
```

**NOTE:** For **namespace-scoped deployments** (configured with the `--set
global.scope=Namespaced` option in the `helm install` command): if you created
your namespace prior to installing the chart, make sure to **add a `name:
<namespace>` label to the namespace** using the following command:

```bash
kubectl label namespaces <namespace> name=<namespace>
```

This label is necessary to get proper validation for KubeFed core APIs. If the
namespace does not already exist, the `helm install` command will create the
namespace with this label by default.

### Uninstalling the Chart 

Due to this helm [issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/4440), the CRDs cannot be deleted
when delete helm release, so before delete the helm release, we need first delete all
of the CR and CRDs for KubeFed release.

Delete all KubeFed `FederatedTypeConfig`:

```bash
$ kubectl -n kube-federation-system delete FederatedTypeConfig --all
```

Delete all KubeFed CRDs:

```bash
$ kubectl delete crd $(kubectl get crd | grep -E 'kubefed.io' | awk '{print $1}')
```

Then you can uninstall/delete the `kubefed` release:

```bash
$ helm delete --purge kubefed
```

The command above removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart
and deletes the release.

At this point you might want to remove Tiller and the namespace as well:

```bash
$ helm reset
$ kubectl delete namespace kube-federation-system
```

## For Helm v3

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.13+
- Helm 3.1.0+

### Installing the Chart

First, add the KubeFed chart repo to your local repository.
```bash
$ helm repo add kubefed-charts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/master/charts

$ helm repo list
NAME            URL
kubefed-charts   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/master/charts
```

With the repo added, available charts and versions can be viewed.
```bash
$ helm search kubefed
```

Helm3 is no longer creating namespaces, so we have to do it manually
```bash
$ kubectl create namespace kube-federation-system
```

Install the chart and specify the version to install with the
`--version` argument. Replace `<x.x.x>` with your desired version.

```bash
helm install kubefed-crds kubefed-charts/kubefed-crds --version=<x.x.x> --namespace kube-federation-system
```
> this will yield an error "Error: no objects visited" that you can safely ignore
> see: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/4670


```bash
helm install kubefed kubefed-charts/kubefed --version=<x.x.x> --namespace kube-federation-system
```
> You will see info messages "manifest_sorter.go:192: info: skipping unknown hook: "crd-install" "
> crd-install hook have been deprecated in favour of crds folders. You can ignore these messages.

### Uninstalling the Chart

Due to this helm [issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/4440), the CRDs cannot be deleted
when delete helm release, so before delete the helm release, we need first delete all
of the CR and CRDs for KubeFed release.

Delete all KubeFed `FederatedTypeConfig`:

```bash
$ kubectl -n kube-federation-system delete FederatedTypeConfig --all
```

Delete all KubeFed CRDs:

```bash
$ kubectl delete crd $(kubectl get crd | grep -E 'kubefed.io' | awk '{print $1}')
```

Then you can uninstall/delete the `kubefed` release:

```bash
$ helm delete kubefed --namespace kube-federation-system
```

you will have to delete kubefed-crd as well
```bash
$ helm delete kubefed-crds --namespace kube-federation-system
```
> this will yield an error "Error: uninstallation completed with 1 error(s): object not found, skipping delete" that you can safely ignore
> see: https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/4670

The command above removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart
and deletes the release.

Finally delete the namespace
```bash
$ kubectl delete namespace kube-federation-system
```

chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to
`helm install`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be
provided while installing the chart. For example:

```bash
$ helm install kubefed-charts/kubefed --name kubefed --namespace kube-federation-system --values values.yaml
```
